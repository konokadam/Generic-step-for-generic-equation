# Generic-step-for-generic-equation

A generic step for the integration of the generic equation set. This is an object oriented style Fortran 2008 code. It includes Euler and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods. Any step method such as different order Runge-Kutta methods can be added easily. Derived steps can be used for any equation by extending the derivative_abstract_type as given by the example.
